This github project is being used alongside a Jira project board + sprints to complete the Issue Tracker project.<br>
A list of the intended sprints will be included at the bottom of this Readme.

# Issue Tracker v0.1

This project is being created using the MVC design pattern. The UI (view) will be created first and then a database will be instantiated through Google Firebase. The controller logic will be written to provide updated views using the data store which is handled by the model.

For this project, I am focusing on an issue/bug tracker as it is a ubiquitous tool in the industry, and the author of the project has used a similar help desk ticketing system in an enterprise setting. Thus, the details of the software/webapp are already familiar to the author.

I will be utilising the .NET Framework for the webapp as it is an industry standard and has been recommended, alongside the C# language, as entry-level friendly skills that are commonly sought after.
