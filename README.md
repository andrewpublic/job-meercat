This github project is being used alongside a Jira project board + sprints to complete the Issue Tracker project.<br>
A list of the intended sprints will be included at the bottom of this Readme.

# Issue Tracker v0.1

This project is being created using the MVC design pattern. The UI (view) will be created first and then a database will be instantiated through Google Firebase. The controller logic will be written to provide updated views using the data store which is handled by the model.

We are focusing on an issue/bug tracker as it is a ubiquitous tool in the industry, and the author of the project has used a similar help desk ticketing system in an enterprise setting. Thus, the details of the software/webapp are already familiar to the author.

We will utilise the .NET Framework for the webapp as it is an industry standard and has been recommended, alongside the C# language, as entry-level friendly skills that are commonly sought after.
